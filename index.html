        About me: <br>  I've wanted to make games for a long time. When my parents told me that I can't be playing around all day, 
        I worked to find a loophole--making them myself! When it comes to games, I play a little bit of everything, but I prefer JRPGs the most. 
        I love the <em class="gametitle">Xenoblade</em> Games, <em class="gametitle">Persona</em> series, and <em class="gametitle">The Legend of Heroes</em> 
        series, just to name a few. <br> <br> My goal for this class is to primarily learn about JavaScript, just because I've been interested in it since 
        I was forced to use code.org in elementary school. I'm here in GDD to, well, make games. I get to learn how to turn a creative vision into an 
        interactive experience for others, and part of why I'm here at RIT is to either get a job in the industry, or meet people I trust with whom I'd 
        like to eventually form an independent studio. By the time I graduate, I would hope to have already secured some job in the industry. <br> <br>
